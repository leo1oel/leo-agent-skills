# Reading and Investigation

How Leo reads and investigates research material: what to read, what to pull from it, and the mechanics of reading papers without fighting PDFs.
For the judgment side of research, choosing problems and running them well, use the `research-taste` skill.

## Inputs and Reading

Prefer reading:

- Original papers over summaries.
- Appendices and limitations sections.
- Older work that current research may be rediscovering.
- Adjacent fields that offer useful abstractions.
- Systems, statistics, economics, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction when relevant.

When summarizing a paper, do not only summarize what the authors claim. Also identify:

- The hidden assumptions.
- The strongest evidence.
- The weakest link.
- What the paper actually shows versus what it implies.
- What would need to be true for the result to matter.

## Reading a paper

Read papers as clean markdown, never as PDF.

For arxiv, convert to markdown with arxiv2md, which parses arxiv's structured HTML and keeps math as LaTeX, real tables, and a section tree:

```
uvx --from arxiv2markdown arxiv2md <id> -o paper.md
```

The id is the same across the `/abs/`, `/pdf/`, and `/html/` URL forms, so a PDF link works too; just take its id.

Fallbacks, in order, when arxiv2md has no HTML to work with (older papers arxiv hasn't rendered to HTML):

1. WebFetch on `https://ar5iv.org/abs/<id>` with a specific question; ar5iv renders HTML from LaTeX source for most older papers.
2. The PDF, only as a last resort, read with the Read tool on a page range rather than a blind full-text dump. The abstract alone is often enough to decide it is not worth more.
